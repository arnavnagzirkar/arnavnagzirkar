## Hi, I’m Arnav 👋

I’m a 4th year Honours Bachelor of Science student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics. I’m interested in machine learning, systems, and building real products at scale.

I enjoy working on projects that combine software engineering, data, and applied ML, especially in fintech, analytics, and developer tooling.
