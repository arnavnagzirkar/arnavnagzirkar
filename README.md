## Hi, I’m Arnav 👋

I’m a 4th year Honours Bachelor of Science student at the University of Toronto, studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics. I’m interested in machine learning, full stack and systems development, and building real products at scale.

I enjoy working on projects that combine software engineering, data, and applied ML.
